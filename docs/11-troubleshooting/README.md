The easiest way to find your logs is

1. navigate to Lambda,

1. open your Unicorn Service,

1. click `Monitoring`

## Error access denied

Assuming you have successfully completed all of Module 1 and had the API working from Postman it's likely your authentication token has simply hit the 1 hour timeout.

Try getting a new auth token following the same instructions as in [01 add authentication module 1f][https://github.com/nib-health-funds/aws-serverless-security-workshop/tree/niblify/docs/01-add-authentication#module-1f-use-the-partner-company-client-credentials-to-customize-unicorns]


## Unable to read index

This is typically if you haven't updated the dbUtils.js with the Aurora connection string, see [00 initial setup module 0d][./aws-serverless-security-workshop/tree/niblify/docs/00-initial-setup#module-0d-run-your-serverless-application-locally-with-sam-local]
